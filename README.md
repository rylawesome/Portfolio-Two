Portfolio 2

Enjoyed the portfolio rework a lot. It showed how much I've picked up since the last time I worked on it, and making the images more responsive and whole site mobile focused was pretty fun. I stuck with my original color palette as it worked well last time, but removed the font because it looked corny.

Was originally going to implement more js for linking pages, but ended up sticking with html/css for the layout to make things easier for myself.

There are a lot of items I still want to improve on this page, including:
Contact form to remove email/phone # from public site, likely with an API
Improved projects
Update About Me info
LinkedIn Profile
However, for an initial layout this gives me a lot to work with.
